<!-- 
NAMING VARIABLES
Be careful with your variable names, because it’s easy to misspell
them. Even if you just get the capitalization wrong, the JavaScript
interpreter won’t know what you mean! For example, if you accidentally used a lowercase c in numberOfCandies, you’d get an error:
numberOfcandies / numberOfSiblings;
ReferenceError: numberOfcandies is not defined
Unfortunately, JavaScript will only do exactly what you ask it
to do. -->

<!-- JavaScript lets you perform basic mathematical operations like
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To make these
calculations, we use the symbols 
+,
 -, 
 *, 
  /, which are called
operators.
You can use the JavaScript console just like a calculator. 

Check some calculations on the console -->

<!-- REASSIGNING VARIABLES -->
<!-- JavaScript lets you reassign variables 
var lastName = "Kelechi";
console.log(firstName)

lastName = "okonkwo"; -->

<!-- 
INCREMENTING AND DECREMENTING
In JavaScript you’ll often need to increase or decrease the
value of a variable containing a number by 1. For example, you
might have a variable that counts the number of high-fives you
received today. Each time someone high-fives you, you’d want to
increase that variable by 1.
Increasing by 1 is called incrementing, and decreasing by 1 is
called decrementing. You increment and decrement using the operators ++ and --.
var highFives = 0;
++highFives;
1
++highFives;
2
--highFives;
1
When we use the ++ operator, the value of highFives goes up by 1,
and when we use the -- operator, it goes down by 1.


+= (plus-equals) and
–= (minus-equals)
To increase the value of a variable by a certain amount, you could
use this code:
var x = 10;
x = x + 5;
x;
15
Here, we start out with a variable called x, set to 10. Then, we
assign x + 5 to x. Because x was 10, x + 5 will be 15. What we’re
doing here is using the old value of x to work out a new value for x.
Therefore, x = x + 5 really means “add 5 to x.” Same princeple applies to - -->

DATA TYPE AND VARIABLES
Strings, Booleans and number

STRINGS
Stringns and sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. It could contain number or symbols
var aString = 'i am a string number 1!'
 CHECKING LENGHT OF STRING 
 var stringLenght = aString.lenght
 ASSESSING A STRING 
 var getChar = aString[4]
