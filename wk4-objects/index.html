<!-- OBJECTS
Objects in JavaScript are very similar to arrays, but
objects use strings instead of numbers to access the
different elements. The strings are called keys or
properties, and the elements they point to are called
values. Together these pieces of information are called
key-value pairs. While arrays are mostly used to
represent lists of multiple things, objects are often

In the previous session  we made several arrays
that listed different animal names. But what if we wanted to
store different pieces of information about one animal?

Creating Objects
We could store lots of information about a single animal by creating a JavaScript object. Here’s an object that stores information
about a three-legged cat named mickey.
var cat = {
 legs: 4,
 name: "mickey",
 color: "grey"
};
Here we create a variable called cat
and assign an object to it with three keyvalue pairs. To create an object, we use
curly brackets, {}, instead of the straight
brackets we used to make arrays. In
between the curly brackets, we enter
key-value pairs. The curly brackets and
everything in between them are called
an object literal. An object literal is a
way of creating an object by writing out
the entire object at once.

Note We’ve also seen array literals (for example, ["a", "b", "c"]), number
literals (for example, 37), string literals (for example, "moose"), and
Boolean literals (true and false). Literal just means that the whole
value is written out at once, not built up in multiple steps.

For example, if you wanted to make an array with the numbers
1 through 3 in it, you could use the array literal [1, 2, 3]. Or you
could create an empty array and then use the push method to add 1,
2, and 3 to the array. You don’t always know at first what’s going to
be in your array or object, which is why you can’t always use literals
to build arrays and objects.

When you create an object, the
key goes before the colon (:), and
the value goes after. The colon acts
a bit like an equal sign—the values
on the right get assigned to the
names on the left, just like when
you create variables. In between
each key-value pair, you have to
put a comma but you don’t need a comma after the last keyvalue pair (color: "grey"). Because it’s the last key-value
pair, the closing curly bracket comes next, instead of a comma.
Keys Without Quotes

Notice that we didnt put quotes around the keys. JavaScript knows that the keys will always be strings, which
is why you can leave out the quotes. If you don’t put quotes around
the keys, the unquoted keys have to follow the same rules as variable names: spaces aren’t allowed in an unquoted key, for example.
If you put the key in quotes, then spaces are allowed:
var cat = {
 legs: 3,
 "full name": "Harmony Philomena Snuggly-Pants Morgan",
 color: "Tortoiseshell"
}; -->

<!-- ACCESSING AN OBJECT -->
<!-- You can access values in objects using square brackets, just like
with arrays. The only difference is that instead of the index (a
number), you use the key (a string).
cat["name"];
"Harmony"
Just as the quotes around keys are optional when you create
an object literal, the quotes are also optional when you are accessing keys in objects. If you’re not going to use quotes, however, the
code looks a bit different:
cat.name;
"Harmony"
This style is called dot notation. Instead of typing the key
name in quotes inside square brackets after the object name, we
just use a period, followed by the key, without any quotes. As with
unquoted keys in object literals, this will work only if the key
doesn’t contain any special characters, such as spaces.
Objects 67
Instead of looking up a value by typing its key, say you wanted
to get a list of all the keys in an object. JavaScript gives you an
easy way to do that, using Object.keys():
var dog = { name: "Pancake", age: 6, color: "white", bark: "Yip yap 
yip!" };
var cat = { name: "Harmony", age: 8, color: "tortoiseshell" };
Object.keys(dog);
["name", "age", "color", "bark"]
Object.keys(cat);
["name", "age", "color"] -->
