<!-- ARRAYS  
Numbers and strings are kind of boring. There’s not a lot that you can do with a string on its own. JavaScript lets you create and group together
data in more interesting ways with arrays. An array is just a list of other JavaScript data values. 

For example, if your friend asked you what your favorite dinosaurs were, you could create an array with the names of
those dinosaurs, in order:
var myDinosaurs = ["T-Rex", "Velociraptor", "Stegosaurus", "Triceratops", "Brachiosaurus", "Pteranodon", "Apatosaurus", "Diplodocus","Compsogna];
So instead of giving your friend three separate strings, you
can just use the single array myDinosaurs.

To create an array, you just use square brackets, []. 
In fact, an empty array is simply a pair of square brackets, like this:
[];
[]

To create an array with values in it, enter the values, separated by commas, between the square brackets. We can call the
individual values in an array items or elements. In this example,
our elements will be strings (the names of our favorite dinosaurs),
so we’ll write them with quote marks. We’ll store the array in a
variable called dinosaurs:
var dinosaurs = ["T-Rex", "Velociraptor", "Stegosaurus", "Triceratops", "Brachiosaurus", "Pteranodon", "Apatosaurus", "Diplodocus", "Compsognathus"];


ACCESSING AN ARRAYS ELEMENT
When it’s time to access elements in an array, you use square
brackets with the index of the element you want, as you can see
in the following example:
dinosaurs[0];
"T-Rex"
dinosaurs[3];
"Triceratops"

An index is the number that corresponds to (or matches) the
spot in the array where a value is stored. Just as with strings, the
first element in an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1,
the third at index 2, and so on. That’s when you ask for index 0
from the dinosaurs array returns "T-Rex" (which is first in the list),
and index 3 returns "Triceratops" (which is fourth in the list). 
Arrays 43

It’s useful to be able to access individual elements from an
array. For example, if you just wanted to show someone your absolute favorite dinosaur, you wouldn’t need the whole dinosaurs array.
Instead you would just want the first element:
dinosaurs[0];
"T-Rex"

<!-- FINDING THE LENGTH OF AN ARRAY
Sometimes it’s useful to know how many elements there are in
an array. For example, if you kept adding dinosaurs to your dinosaurs
array, you might forget how many dinosaurs you have.
The length property of an array tells you how many elements
there are in the array. To find the length of an array, just add
.length to the end of its name. Let’s try it out. First we’ll make a
new array with three elements:
var maniacs = ["Yakko", "Wakko", "Dot"];
maniacs[0];
"Yakko"
maniacs[1];
"Wakko"
maniacs[2];
"Dot"
To find the length of the array, add .length to maniacs:
maniacs.length;
3
JavaScript tells us that there are 3 elements in the array, and
we already know they have the index positions 0, 1, and 2. This
gives us a useful piece of information: the last index in an array is
always the same number as the length of the array minus 1. This
means that there is an easy way to access the last element in an
array, however long that array is:
maniacs[maniacs.length - 1];
"Dot" -->

ADDING ELEMENTS TO ARRAY
To add an element to the end of an array, you can use the push
method. Add .push to the array name, followed by the element you
want to add inside parentheses, like this:
var animals = [];
animals.push("Cat");
1
animals.push("Dog");
2
animals.push("Llama");
3
animals;
["Cat", "Dog", "Llama"]
animals.length;
3
Here we create an empty array with
var animals = [];, and then use the push
method to add "Cat" to the array. Then,
we use push again to add on "Dog" and
then "Llama". When we display animals;,
we see that "Cat", "Dog", and "Llama" were
added to the array, in the same order we
entered them.
The act of running a method in
computer-speak is known as calling the
method. When you call the push method,
two things happen. First, the element
in parentheses is added to the array.
Second, the new length of the array is
returned. That’s why you see those numbers printed out every time you call push.
48 Chapter 3
To add an element to the beginning of an array, you can use
.unshift(element), like this:
animals;
["Cat", "Dog", "Llama"]
u animals[0];
"Cat"
animals.unshift("Monkey");
4
animals;
["Monkey", "Cat", "Dog", "Llama"]
animals.unshift("Polar Bear");
5
animals;
["Polar Bear", "Monkey", "Cat", "Dog", "Llama"]
animals[0];
"Polar Bear"
v animals[2];
"Cat"

<!-- Creating a Random Insult Generator
We can extend the decision maker example to create a program
that generates a random insult every time you run it!
var randomBodyParts = ["Face", "Nose", "Hair"];
var randomAdjectives = ["Smelly", "Boring", "Stupid"];
var randomWords = ["Fly", "Marmot", "Stick", "Monkey", "Rat"];
// Pick a random body part from the randomBodyParts array:
u var randomBodyPart = randomBodyParts[Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)];
// Pick a random adjective from the randomAdjectives array:
v var randomAdjective = randomAdjectives[Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)];
// Pick a random word from the randomWords array:
w var randomWord = randomWords[Math.floor(Math.random() * 5)];
// Join all the random strings into a sentence:
var randomInsult = "Your " + randomBodyPart + " is like a " + 
randomAdjective + " " + randomWord + "!!!";
randomInsult;
"Your Nose is like a Stupid Marmot!!!" -->
